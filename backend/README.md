# Reminders to myself: 
- The IDE that I used was VS Code
- To start the server/api locally, run `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`

# Some heroku commands:
- To deploy on heroku: git push heorku main (or any other branch name)
- To view the URL that the api/server is running on in heroku: heroku open
- To view logs on heroku: heroku logs --tail
- To access the postgres instance running on heroku: heroku pg:psql
